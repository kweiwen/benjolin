* This is a DIY Eurorack project based on Rob Hordijk's Benjolin design.

# Modifications
* Addition of an external audio input for the filter.
* Voltage-controlled pitch for both oscillators.
* Voltage-controlled frequency for the low-pass filter.
* Disconnection of T2 from the filter (Note: T2 can still be connected to the filter's CV input via cable).
* Integration of an SPST switch to select the current input (P1 or a -9~9V voltage with a potentiometer) for the BC547.

# Voltage Outputs
* Tri1 Out: ~6Vpp
* Pul1 Out: ~12Vpp
* Tri2 Out: ~6Vpp
* Pul2 Out: ~12Vpp
* PWM Out: ~18Vpp
* Main Out: ~2Vpp
